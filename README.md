### International Space Apps Challenge 2013

This is a repository for my (potential) contribution to the [International Space Apps Challenge 2013](http://spaceappschallenge.org/). I will not be able to join the competition since the Hackathon (20-21/4) clashes with a lot of other stuff for me. But, I'm hoping to complete at least a rough prototype of the _**Moonville**_ platform until then.

_**Moonville**_ is a "pluggable" game structure built in Python (using [cocos2d](http://cocos2d.org/)) where players can themselves add games, items, sound and graphics. For the International Space Apps Challenge weekend I hope to be able to fill the structure wih enough content to have a playable children's game (5+ years).

See the [wiki](https://github.com/johanlindberg/moonville/wiki) for more information. If you have any ideas, thoughts or opinions about what should and should not be included please let me know.
