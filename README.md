### Space Apps Challenge 2013

This is a repository for my (potential) contribution to the [NASA Space Apps Challenge 2013](http://spaceappschallenge.org/). I will not be able to join the competition since the Hackathon (20-21/4) clashes with a lot of other stuff for me. But, I'm hoping to build a rough, playable prototype of a simulation game I will call _Moonville_.

I plan to build a "pluggable" game structure in Python (using [cocos2d](http://cocos2d.org/)) where players can themselves add levels, items and possibly even game mechanics and graphics. For the Space Apps Challenge weekend I hope to be able to fill the structure wih enough game content to have a playable children's game (5+ years).
